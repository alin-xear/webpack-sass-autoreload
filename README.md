By default the [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js) will use its built-in optimizations for **production**. To expand all files in a developer-friendly view, set the [mode option](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/) to **development**.

```
npm install
```

> After cloning this repository, install all dependencies.

```
npm run dev
```

> Continue development in the live reload environment available at http://localhost:8000.

```
npm run build
```

> Create an optimized production build.
